# Project-Info-2022-MCSimulation-
Informatic project M1S2 on Monte-Carlo simulation in the SiTrInEO experiment.

The project is composed of four files:
  
  *requirement.txt :*
 file to install in order to set up the virtual environment to have access to all libraries and their accurate version. It contains matplotlib,  numpy, gauss and   landaupy that are used in the other files.

  *Main(1).ipynb*
First part of the project, corresponding to the tracking of the particles.
 
  *Pixel_Firing_Threshold.ipynb*
Second part of the project, corresponding to the activation of the detectors pixels. The code works independently from the previous one.
 
  *Multiple_Scattering.ipynb*
Third part of the project, corresponding to the multiple scattering of the particles in the detectors. This part should be inject into the Pixel_Firing_Threshold but unfortunately doesn't work. 

Have fun!
